Online-Trading
==============
Based on the client-server model, Berkeley Sockets, shared memory and POSIX named semaphores were used to implement a concurrent server that facilitated a number of Buyers/Sellers to participate in trading activities. The various functions included role-based log in, submitting a buy/sell request, viewing the best buy/sell prospects in the market, viewing the set of matched trades and viewing trade history.
